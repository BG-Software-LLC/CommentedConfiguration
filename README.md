# CommentedConfiguration
I am using this class in my plugins, to make sure the configs are always updated with the one resource files.
This also gives the ability to have an ingame config editor, without losing comments when saving the config.


You are freely to use the resource and/or modify it, but you are not allowed to claim it as your own, and you
must credit me (Ome_R / OmerBenGera) when using it (there's a comment with a credit - just don't remove it).
You are more than welcome to make pull requests, submit issues and give feedback :)
